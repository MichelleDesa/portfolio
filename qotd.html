	  Qotd was a web QnA based customer engagement platform, to help companies connect with their customers and tap into the expertise of the community surrounding their products, services. I worked with the other designer on the team at Helpshift (then Infinitely Beta) and the co-founders to design the Qotd product experience.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I worked on the information architecture, interaction design of the entire product, which included the public community and the private community management interfaces. I also worked on the visual design of the themable interface and worked with the rest of the frontend team to develop the interface implementation, working primarily on the HTML, CSS and templating (Jinja templates).

	  I also contributed to the design of the sales website and worked particularly on the feature illustrations for the site. I also worked with a couple of other members of the team on the development of this website (the HTML, CSS).

	Qotd is no longer a live product, much of what we learned while building the platform was useful in developing the community portal of HelpshiftCRM, the next product I worked on at Helpshift.
