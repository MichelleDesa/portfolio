	<p>
	  Ask the experts was a domain-specific QnA based community discussion platform. It was the first project I worked on as a product designer at Helpshift (then Infinitely Beta). It was intended as a feature enhancement to Paisa.com, a fresh way to track, compare and analyze financial markets and products in India, the core product of the company at the time.

	<p>
	  I worked as the product designer on Ask the experts, together with the other designer on the team and the co-founders. I worked on distillation of the product featureset after extensive research and brainstorming with the team, and was responsible for the product information  architecture, interaction design and visual design. I also contributed to the interface development, working on the HTML, CSS and templating for the product.

	  Paisa.com is no longer online and with it Ask the experts, the overwhelming positive feedback we received for the platform was one of the factors that motivated us to create our next product Qotd, which provided a similar more general purpose solution.
