      <p>
	Helpshift provides an embeddable support solution designed for native apps. Helpshift was one of the products I worked on as an in-house designer at Helpshift. 
      </p>
      <p>
	The support platform provides an SDK to be integrated with the native app, this SDK provides a support interface for app customers. Here they can find solutions to common problems in the FAQ listing and it also allows direct communication with app developer or support team through support issues. 	
      </p>
      <p>
	I was responsible for the interaction design of the first version of the SDK interface for iOS and worked in collaboration with the co-founders and advisors. The library needed to engage users of a variety of different apps varying considerably in look and feel. Keeping this in mind we decided to go with a native, familiar iOS experience for the library interface look and feel for the first version, till we could support theming for the interface.

	The SDK support interface is supplemented with a responsive web interface that supports the same functionality. I was responsible for the interaction design, visual design of this web interface and contributed to the interface implementation working on HTML, CSS and templating (mustache templates). For the web interface, the issue reporting interaction was handled using an email-based system and I was responsible for the design, coding of the related conversation digest email.

	Helpshift's support solution provides a web-based admin dashboard to manage support for multiple apps and platforms, I contributed to the interface implementation for minor feature enhancements for this interface. For example, the configuration interface for the second version of the support SDK interface to customize the library for each app.

	While working on Helpshift I also worked on the design of experimental features for the product. I created wireframes and high fidelity photoshop mocks, to facilitate discussion with customers and test interest in new features. For example, a feature to create easily customizable public landing pages for apps using Helpshift.
