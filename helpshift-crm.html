	  HelpshiftCRM provides a complete, social web-based customer support solution. The product offering includes an extensive set of features customizable to meet the requirements of a broad spectrum of customers from startups to established large organizations. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  Together with the other designer on the team at Helpshift, I was responsible for working with the founders and a few members of the development team to design the HelpshiftCRM product experience. Considering that the online support solution market was already a fairly saturated market, I brainstormed with the team and did extensive competitor research to arrive at a first cut feature set and product experience that would give HelpshiftCRM a distinct edge. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  Further I was responsible for the information architecture, interaction design, visual design and interface development of a majority of customer-facing features (as opposed to support agent-facing features) of the product offering. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  One of the key features of the product is the customer community portal, it provides a themeable , customizable platform for discussion in the form of questions posted to the community, and helps customers find solutions to known issues directly from the community, the article knowledgebase or the video library. It also facilitates idea management by allowing community members to post ideas for review. I was responsible for the information architecture, interaction design along with visual design and interface development (the HTML and CSS) of this part of the product.

	  A themable, customizable web-widget is also provided, to embed support directly into the website of the product of service using HelpshiftCRM. I worked on the interface design and development of this web-widget.

	  The support solution integrates with numerous support channels like twitter, facebook, email, and also provides a live chat system. I was involved in design enhancements and contributed to the interface development of the chat system.

	<p>
	  HelpshiftCRM provides a unique co-browsing feature, that allows support agents to browse a webpage at the same time as the customer providing a more personal, interactive support experience. I worked on the interaction and  visual design of the co-browsing system as well as on the CSS and HTML to implement these interface changes.

	  Another key part of the support solution is the support agent dashboard, the interface to manage conversations on various channels and the community portal, customize of the parts and features of support solution. It also provides a support overview through the analytics section.
I contributed to minor interface development of this part of the product as well.
